This code deploys the model and the results presented in the paper _The stability paradox_ that can be found in the following link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T-ROtIpCG-7t_AbToFVC0C4Z4Qmo4_5f/view

The idea of the code in this directory is to create a monetary policy laboratory where the user is able to play with the initial conditions and parameters of a nonlinear economic model eventually reproducing the same findings of the paper if wanted but also with the possibility of going further beyond. The model was developed to study the effects of monetary policy in an economy displaying Keynes-Misky cycles and more details about it can be found in the paper while the details about the code functionality can be found int he code itself.
